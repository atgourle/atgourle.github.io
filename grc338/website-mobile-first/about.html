      <h2> About </h2>
      <h3> It all starts with Ryan Sherwood</h3>
      <p>  Decades ago, Ryan Sherwood's bold vision and recipe for success laid the foundation for one of the world’s most legendary steak houses.   </p>
      <h3> From Humble Beginnings</h3>
      <p> In 1965 our founder Ryan Sherwood risked it all and mortgaged his home to buy a small steak house in Laguna Beach. As a college dropout, Sherwood taught himself the restaurant business, endured countless challenges and, in the process, redefined hospitality.</p>
      <h3> Our Values</h3>
      <p> We are committed to: Creating “Guests for Life” that are loyal to the Sherwood brand. Providing a positive, safe and supportive work environment in which hospitality-minded employees are developed, trained and rewarded.Continuous improvement and company growth. Fostering lasting relationships with vendors, business associates, and communities where we do business.</p>
      <h3> Our Mission</h3>
      <p> At Sherwood Steakhouse, we aspire to create the finest experience for our guests by combining the highest quality steaks and seafood, with exceptional service in a cosmopolitan and entertaining atmosphere.</p>
